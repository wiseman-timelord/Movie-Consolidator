# Movie Consolidator
Status: Alpha (early version)

## Description
A program that generates condensed, action-packed summaries of gaming videos using motion and texture analysis. It provides a user-friendly Gradio interface to adjust parameters and view results.

## Features
- **Gradio Interface**: A web-based interface for interactive input and output.
- **Motion and Texture Analysis**: Identifies high-action segments in gaming videos.
- **Adjustable Thresholds**: Users can set motion and texture thresholds for analysis.
- **Video Summarization**: Generates condensed video summaries focusing on high-action segments.
- **Supports Multiple Video Formats**: Compatible with various video file types.
- **Efficient Processing**: Optimized for fast video analysis and summarization.

## Preview
- Include placeholders for screenshots of the interface and any visual outputs.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **OpenCV library** for video processing
- **moviepy** for video editing
- **Gradio** for the web interface
- **OS**: Windows, for Windows Gaming. 

## Usage
1. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository from GitHub.
   - Install required libraries using pip.
2. **Running the Program**:
   - Execute the main script to launch the Gradio interface.
   - Upload a gaming video and adjust the motion and texture thresholds.
   - Generate and download the condensed video summary.
## Notation
- Mention any limitations or issues, such as the need for CUDA for better performance if we decide to add it later.

## Files Created
- `output/`: Contains the condensed video summaries generated by the program.
- `data/temporary.py`: Stores user settings and thresholds.

## Development
- **Future plans**:
  - Implement GPU acceleration using CUDA for faster processing.
  - Add support for real-time video summarization.
  - Integrate additional features like audio analysis for better summary accuracy.

## Credits
- **OpenCV**: For video processing functions.
- **moviepy**: For video editing capabilities.
- **Gradio**: For creating the web interface.
